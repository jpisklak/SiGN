#' Terminal Link Duration Adjustment for S- Signals
#'
#' Adjusts the terminal link duration for signalled extinction.
#'
#' @param tl_dur Numeric vector. Duration of the terminal link.
#' @param tr_p Numeric vector. Probability of terminal reinforcement following
#' the terminal link.
#' @param s_delta Numeric scalar or vector. Duration of the S- signal to use
#' when terminal reinforcement probability is zero.
#'
#' @returns A numeric vector where elements of `tl_dur` are replaced by
#' `s_delta` if the terminal link has a non-zero duration and a
#' reinforcement probability of zero.
#'
#' @details
#' The function is named `s_delta()` in reference to the operant conditioning
#' notation \eqn{S^\Delta}, which denotes a stimulus that signals the
#' unavailability of reinforcement (i.e., extinction). This distinguishes it
#' from \eqn{S^{-}}, a term more commonly used in respondent (Pavlovian)
#' conditioning to indicate a stimulus associated with the absence of an
#' unconditioned stimulus. However, due to theoretical overlap between operant
#' and respondent frameworks, \eqn{S^{-}} is often (regrettably) used
#' interchangeably with \eqn{S^\Delta}, despite their distinct origins. A
#' similar issue arises with the notation \eqn{S^{D}} (used in operant contexts
#' to denote a discriminative stimulus for reinforcement) and \eqn{S^{+}} (its
#' respondent counterpart), which are likewise sometimes conflated.
