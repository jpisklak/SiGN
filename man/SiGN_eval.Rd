\title{Evaluate Model Fit with Descriptive and Likelihood-Based Metrics}
\usage{
SiGN_eval(observed, predicted, epsilon = 0.001)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A numeric vector of observed values (e.g., choice
proportions). Values must lie within the interval (0, 1). This function
assumes a beta-distributed error model, which is not defined at 0 or 1.}

\item{predicted}{A numeric vector of predicted values. Must be the same length as \code{observed}, and also constrained to the interval (0, 1).}

\item{epsilon}{A small continuity correction used to constrain values
strictly within the open interval (0, 1). Defaults to \code{0.001}. This is
necessary for the beta error model, which is undefined at 0 and 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"SiGN_eval"} containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{summary}}{A data frame of descriptive fit statistics: sample
size, R-squared, mean bias, RMSE, MAE, median absolute error, and the
concordance correlation coefficient.}
\item{\code{info_criteria}}{A data frame with the estimated \eqn{\phi}
parameter (precision of the beta distribution),
log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC.}
\item{\code{residuals}}{A numeric vector of residuals (observed -
predicted), not printed by default.}
}
}
\description{
Computes a variety of descriptive and likelihood-based statistics for
evaluating the fit of a model to observed data. This includes common
error metrics, a concordance coefficient, and information criteria
(AIC, BIC) based on a beta-distributed error model.
}
\details{
The information criteria assume that the predicted values were generated by
a model or function with no free parameters. The only fitted parameter is
the precision parameter (\eqn{\phi}) of the error model, which is shared
across all observations.

The residual-based coefficient of determination (\eqn{R^2}) is calculated
as:
\deqn{R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
where \eqn{y_i} are the observed values, \eqn{\hat{y}_i} are the predicted
values, and \eqn{\bar{y}} is the mean of the observed values.

For likelihood-based metrics, the function assumes a beta-distributed
error model:
\deqn{y_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i)}
with:
\deqn{\alpha_i = \mu_i \cdot \phi,\quad \beta_i = (1 - \mu_i) \cdot \phi}
where \eqn{\mu_i} is the predicted value and \eqn{\phi} is the precision
parameter.

The total log-likelihood is computed as:
\deqn{\log L = \sum_i \log \left[ \text{Beta}(y_i; \alpha_i, \beta_i) \right]}

The AIC and BIC are then computed as:
\deqn{\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\log L,\quad \text{BIC} = \log(n) \cdot k - 2\log L}
where \eqn{k = 1} is the number of estimated parameters (here, only
\eqn{\phi}) and \eqn{n} is the number of observations.

Observed and predicted values are assumed to lie strictly within the unit
interval (0, 1). Values near 0 or 1 are adjusted using the \code{epsilon}
parameter to avoid undefined behaviour under the beta distribution.

The choice of \code{epsilon} can strongly influence the log-likelihood,
particularly when values approach 0 or 1. Users are encouraged to check the
sensitivity of the output to this value if model selection is a focus.

When the sample size is less than 30, a message is printed to remind users
that information criteria may be unstable or overly sensitive in
small-sample settings.
