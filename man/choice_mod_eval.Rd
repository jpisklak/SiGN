\usage{
choice_mod_eval(observed, predicted, k = 0, epsilon = 0.001, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{observed}{A numeric vector of observed values (e.g., choice
proportions). Values must lie within the closed interval \verb{[0, 1]}.}

\item{predicted}{A numeric vector of predicted values. Must be the same
length as \code{observed}, and also constrained to the closed interval \verb{[0, 1]}.}

\item{k}{An integer specifying the number of free parameters that were used
to generate the \code{predicted} values. The function incorporates an error
model that adds one to this value (see Details).}

\item{epsilon}{A small continuity correction used to constrain values
strictly within the open interval (0, 1). Defaults to \code{0.001}. This is
necessary for the beta error model, which is undefined at 0 and 1.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to internal functions.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"choice_mod_eval"} containing:
\describe{
\item{\code{desc_stats}}{A data frame of descriptive fit statistics: sample
size, R-squared, mean bias, RMSE, MAE, median absolute error, and the
concordance correlation coefficient.}
\item{\code{info_criteria}}{A data frame listing the parameter amount,
estimated \eqn{\phi} parameter value (precision of the beta distribution),
log-likelihood, AIC, and BIC.}
\item{\code{residuals}}{A numeric vector of residuals (observed -
predicted), not printed by default.}
}
}
\description{
Computes a variety of descriptive and likelihood-based statistics for
evaluating the fit of a model to observed data. This includes common
descriptive error metrics, a concordance coefficient, and information
criteria (AIC, BIC) based on a beta-distributed error model.
}
\details{
The residual-based coefficient of determination (\eqn{R^2}) is calculated
as:
\deqn{R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_i (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
where \eqn{y_i} are the observed values, \eqn{\hat{y}_i} are the predicted
values, and \eqn{\bar{y}} is the mean of the observed values.

While this form of \eqn{R^2} is widely used as a descriptive measure of
fit, it should be interpreted with caution in the context of nonlinear models.
Unlike in linear regression, \eqn{R^2} does not have a clear interpretation
in terms of explained variance, nor is it guaranteed to fall between 0 and 1.
In particular, it can take on negative values when the model fits worse than
the mean. As such, it is best used here as a rough, supplementary indicator
of model performance rather than a definitive measure of fit—effectively,
a "pseudo-\eqn{R^2}."

For the likelihood-based metrics in \verb{$info_criteria}, a beta-distributed
error model for choice proportions is incorporated. This adds one fitted
parameter (\eqn{\phi}), which is shared across all observations.
Consequently, AIC and BIC values are computed as having \code{k} + 1 free
parameters.

The error model assumes that each observed value \eqn{y_i} is
drawn independently from a Beta distribution with a mean equal to the
choice model's prediction \eqn{\mu_i} and a precision parameter \eqn{\phi}:
\deqn{y_i \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha_i, \beta_i)}
with:
\deqn{\alpha_i = \mu_i \cdot \phi,\quad \beta_i = (1 - \mu_i) \cdot \phi}
where \eqn{\mu_i} is the predicted value and \eqn{\phi} is the precision
parameter.

The total log-likelihood is computed as:
\deqn{\log L = \sum_i \log \left[ \text{Beta}(y_i | \alpha_i, \beta_i) \right]}

The AIC and BIC are then computed as:
\deqn{\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\log L,\quad \text{BIC} = \log(n) \cdot k - 2\log L}
where \eqn{k = 1} is the number of estimated parameters and \eqn{n} is the number of observations.

Observed and predicted values are assumed to lie strictly within the unit
interval (0, 1). Values near 0 or 1 are adjusted using the \code{epsilon}
parameter to avoid undefined behaviour under the beta distribution.

The choice of \code{epsilon} can strongly influence the log-likelihood,
particularly when values approach 0 or 1. Users are encouraged to check the
sensitivity of the output to this value if model selection is a focus.

When the sample size is less than 30, a message is printed to remind users
that information criteria may be unstable or overly sensitive in
small-sample settings.
