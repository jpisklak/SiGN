\title{Duration of the S‚Å∫ Terminal Link Stimulus}
\usage{
s_plus_dur(sig, tl_dur1, tl_dur2, tr_p1, tr_p2)
}
\arguments{
\item{sig}{Logical. Indicates whether the terminal link stimuli are assumed
to be discriminable. See \link{sig_check}.}

\item{tl_dur1}{Numeric. Duration of the first terminal link.}

\item{tl_dur2}{Numeric. Duration of the second terminal link.}

\item{tr_p1}{Numeric. Probability of terminal (primary/unconditional)
reinforcement following the first terminal link.}

\item{tr_p2}{Numeric. Probability of terminal (primary/unconditional)
reinforcement following the second terminal link.}
}
\value{
A numeric value giving the duration of the \eqn{S^{+}} stimulus, or \code{NA_real_} if \code{sig} is \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Identifies the duration of the \eqn{S^{+}} terminal link stimulus, defined as
the link with the higher reinforcement rate, from two possible terminal
links on an alternative.
}
\details{
The function compares reinforcement rates (i.e., probability of
reinforcement per unit of time) between the two terminal links. If the
stimuli are signalled (\code{sig = TRUE}), the terminal link with the higher
reinforcement rate is assumed to function as \eqn{S^{+}}, and its duration
is returned. If \code{sig = FALSE}, the function returns \code{NA_real_}, as no
discriminable \eqn{S^{+}} stimulus is assumed to exist.
