Default profile values can overridden specifying corresponding arguments directly. argument lengths differ, values recycled maximum length, message. Temporal Units: SiGN model temporally relative, meaning allows initial terminal link durations treated unit time (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.). However, units need consistent across link durations. s_delta Conventionally, concurrent-chains paradigms measured time seconds easily discriminable stimuli. default value s_delta reflects convention. However, shorter longer temporal units used, stimuli takes considerable time discriminated, may prudent adjust s_delta accordingly.

SiGN model assumes (behavioural) function terminal link stimuli remains fixed across entire duration terminal link—, probability terminal reinforcement change partway terminal link. Procedures depart assumption may appropriately handled model.
