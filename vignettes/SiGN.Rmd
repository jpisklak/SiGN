`SiGN` is an R package designed to streamline and automate the computations required to generate behavioural predictions from the Signal for Good News (SiGN) model. 

## Background

Several decades ago, researchers first reported that pigeons (*Columba livia*) sometimes prefer options that yield less food over those that provide more [@Kendall1974]. This behaviour has been described as suboptimal, maladaptive, or paradoxical, as it appears to reduce overall food intake in laboratory settings. The SiGN model accounts for this pattern—and choice behaviour in concurrent-chain schedules more broadly—by proposing that such behaviour is conditionally reinforced when stimuli are associated with a reduction in delay to food.

Detailed information about the model and its calculations can be found in @Dunn2024.

## Assumptions for Using This Package

This package is intended for users with a foundational understanding of operant conditioning, schedules of reinforcement, and concurrent-chain paradigms. If terms like "the Matching Law" or "Delay-Reduction Hypothesis" are unfamiliar, the material and outputs provided by this package may be difficult to interpret.

## Common Abbreviations Used in this Package

- `dur` : duration (in any units)
- `p` : probability
- `il` : initial link
- `tl` : terminal link
- `tr` : terminal reinforcement.

In this package, *terminal reinforcement* (`tr`) refers to the reinforcer delivered at the end of a chain schedule. While this is often a *primary*/*unconditionally* reinforcing stimulus (e.g., food), the SiGN model places no restriction on the nature of this reinforcer—it could just as easily be a *secondary* (i.e., *conditionally*) reinforcing stimulus. For this reason, the more general term *terminal reinforcement*—referring simply to the stimulus that terminates the chain—is preferred.

## Installing the Package

Since the *SiGN* package is currently available only in its development version, the simplest way to install it is via [GitHub](https://github.com/) with ...

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jpisklak/SiGN")
```

## Generating A Model Prediction
There are two steps required to generating predictions from the SiGN model:

1. Use the `choice_params()` function to create a R list of parameters.
2. Input the R list into the `SiGN()` function.

The SiGN model uses the parameters of a concurrent-chains procedure to generate an a priori prediction of a organism's choice behaviour. Those parameters need to be given to the function `SiGN()` in the form of a list. The list can be created manually; however, the *SiGN* package offers a helper function, `choice_params()` to produce it quickly with numerous validation checks "under the hood" to ensure parameters are selected appropriately.

### Example: Stagner & Zentall -@StagnerZentall2010

To illustrate consider the set of contingencies used by Stagner & Zentall -@StagnerZentall2010 diagrammed in Figure 1.

<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='70%', fig.align='center', fig.cap = 'Figure 1. Stagner & Zentall (2010) Contingencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/stag_zen_2010.png")
```

<br>

Notably, there are 16 values that make up this contingency plus two additional values that need to be specified for the SiGN model specifically, giving a total of 18 seperate arguments that need to be set. To expedite the process of listing parameters, the `choice_params()` function has three default profile sets of parameters that can be used and modified. They are `"zentall"` [@StagnerZentall2010], `"kendall"` [@Kendall1985], and `"fantino"` [@Fantino1969].

The `"zentall"` profile already has the parameters shown in Figure 1. An argument `display_params` can be set to `TRUE` to view the 

```{r}
library(SiGN)
params <- choice_params("zentall", display_params = TRUE)
```
