*SiGN* is an R package designed to streamline and automate the calculations required to generate behavioural predictions from the Signal for Good News (SiGN) model.

## Background

Several decades ago, researchers discovered that operant contingencies can be arranged such that pigeons (*Columba livia*) reliably develop a preference for options that yield less food over those that provide more 
(Kendall, 1974). This behaviour—commonly referred to as "suboptimal" choice—results in a systematic reduction in overall food intake under controlled laboratory conditions.

The SiGN model explains this puzzling pattern (and other choice behaviours in concurrent-chains procedures) by proposing that choice is conditionally reinforced when stimuli signal a reduction in the delay to food.

For a detailed description of the model and its calculations, see Dunn et al. (2024).

## Assumptions

This document is intended to illustrate the use of the R package, not explain the SiGN model and all its pre-requisite background information.

To make effective use of this article and package, users are expected to have a foundational understanding of concepts such as ...

- Operant conditioning
- Schedules of reinforcement
- Concurrent and concurrent-chains procedures
- Delay-reduction hypothesis
- And, of course, .... The SiGN (Signal for Good News) model

If these and other related terms are unfamiliar, the explanations and R outputs provided by this document may be difficult to interpret.

Additionally, a working knowledge of R programming is assumed. The examples provided require comfort with vectorised functions, data manipulation, and interpreting model output.

## Common Abbreviations

The following abbreviations are used throughout the package:

- `dur`: duration (any units)
- `p`: probability
- `il`: initial link
- `tl`: terminal link
- `tr`: terminal reinforcement
- `dr`: delay-reduction

FYI: In this context, *terminal reinforcement* refers to the stimulus delivered at the end of a chained schedule. While this is often a *primary* (unconditional) reinforcer such as food, the SiGN model does not require it to be so—it could also be a *secondary* (conditional) reinforcer. For this reason, the more general term *terminal reinforcement* is used by the package.

## Installation

As the SiGN package is currently in development, the easiest way to install it is from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the `pak` package:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jpisklak/SiGN")
```

## Generating a Prediction

There are two steps to generating predictions using the SiGN model:

1. Use `choice_params()` to create a list of model parameters.
2. Pass this list to `SiGN()` to obtain predictions.

The SiGN model uses parameters from a concurrent-chains procedure to generate an a priori prediction of choice behaviour. While the required list of arguments can be created manually, the helper function `choice_params()` simplifies this process and includes built-in checks to ensure valid input.

### Example: Stagner & Zentall (2010)

To illustrate, consider the contingencies described by Stagner and Zentall (2010), illustrated in Figure 1.

<br>

<figure style="margin: 0 auto; padding: 10px; width: 80%;">
  <img src="images/stag_zen_2010.png" style="width: 100%;" />
  <figcaption style="text-align: center;">
    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Stagner & Zentall (2010) contingencies
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

This procedure involves 16 distinct parameters, plus 2 additional parameters specific to the SiGN model—making a total of 18 values that need to be input into the `SiGN()` function. To speed up the process of entering these values, the `choice_params()` function includes several pre-defined profiles: `"zentall"` (Stagner & Zentall, 2010), `"kendall"` (Kendall, 1985), and `"fantino"` (Fantino, 1969).

The `"zentall"` profile matches the setup shown in Figure 1. You can view the full set of parameters by setting `display_params = TRUE`:

```{r}
library(SiGN)
params <- choice_params("zentall", display_params = TRUE)
```

The R documentation `?choice_params` describes each argument, but they are briefly listed in Table 1 below for convenience.

<br>

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  data.frame(
    Parameter = c(
      "`il_dur_a`<br>`il_dur_b`", "`tl_dur_a1`<br>`tl_dur_a2`", "`tl_dur_b1`<br>`tl_dur_b2`",
      "`tl_p_a1`<br>`tl_p_a2`", "`tl_p_b1`<br>`tl_p_b2`", "`tr_p_a1`<br>`tr_p_a2`", "`tr_p_b1`<br>`tr_p_b2`",
      "`il_sched_a`<br>`il_sched_b`", "`s_delta`", "`beta_toggle`"
    ),
    Description = c(
      "Initial link durations for alternative A and B.",
      "Durations for terminal links on A.",
      "Durations for terminal links on B.",
      "Entry probabilities for terminal links on A.",
      "Entry probabilities for terminal links on B.",
      "Reinforcement probabilities for terminal links on A.",
      "Reinforcement probabilities for terminal links on B.",
      "Initial link schedule types (\"VI\" or \"FR\").",
      "Time to perceive a signal for no reinforcement. Default = 1.",
      "Logical toggle to adjust conditional vs. terminal reinforcement (Equation 6, Dunn et al., 2024)."
    )
  ),
  caption = "Table 1: Arguments for Model Parameters",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

In most cases, `s_delta` and `beta_toggle` do not require user modification (see `choice_params()` R documentation).

Once you have your parameter list, you can generate a prediction by passing it to the `SiGN()` function:

```{r}
SiGN(params)
```

From the output, we can see that alternative A (the "suboptimal" alternative) will be selected approximately 96% of the time. To extract additional model details:

```{r}
mod <- SiGN(params)
mod$details
```

An in-depth explanation of the `$details` output is beyond the scope of this document. Readers interested in the theoretical rationale behind these terms are referred to Dunn et al. 2024. However, a brief description of each component is provided in Table 2 below.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  tibble(
    Name = c(
      "cp", "r_a<br>r_b", "r_a_com<br>r_b_com", "Big_T", "cr_a<br>cr_b",
      "dr_avg_a<br>dr_avg_b", "dr_bonus_a<br>dr_bonus_b", "beta_a<br>beta_b",
      "sig_a<br>sig_b", "tr_p_a<br>tr_p_b", "s_delta"
    ),
    Description = c(
      "Predicted proportion of choices made to alternative A.",
      "Rate of terminal reinforcement on each alternative.",
      "Reinforcement rate on each alternative using a common effective initial link duration (when both IL schedules are VI).",
      "Overall average time to terminal reinforcement from the onset of initial links.",
      "Conditional reinforcement for each alternative (i.e., total delay-reduction).",
      "Average delay reduction on each alternative.",
      "Bonus delay reduction (when one TL offers a stronger signal).",
      "Adjustment factor reflecting the balance of conditional vs. terminal reinforcement.",
      "Logical indicator of whether each alternative is considered signalled (see `?sig_check`).",
      "Overall terminal reinforcement probability on each alternative.",
      "The `s_delta` value passed to the `SiGN()` function."
    ),
    `Dunn et al.` = c(
      "$\\frac{R_a}{R_a + R_b}$", "$r_x$", " ", "$T$", "$\\delta_x$ or $D_\\text{total}$",
      "$D_\\text{avg}$", "$D_\\text{bonus}$", "$\\beta_x$", " ", " ", " "
    )
  ),
  caption = "Table 2: Components of the `SiGN()` Function Output (`$details`)",
  escape = FALSE
)
```

## Generating Multiple Predictions

The `SiGN()` function supports vectorised input, allowing users to generate multiple predictions simultaneously. This is particularly useful for examining how predicted choice changes as a function of a single parameter while holding others constant.

As an example, suppose we want to evaluate how increasing the duration of the initial links affects choice behaviour. This can be done by supplying a sequence of values to the `il_dur_a` and `il_dur_b` arguments in `choice_params()`. The rest of the parameters will remain fixed according to the `"zentall"` profile, while these two are overridden.

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4.5, dpi = 300, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '80%'}
# Generate list of parameters
il_preds <- choice_params("zentall",
  il_dur_a = seq(1, 100, by = 0.01),
  il_dur_b = seq(1, 100, by = 0.01)
)

# Generate predictions
mod_il <- SiGN(il_preds)

# Plot predictions
plot(il_preds$il_dur_a, mod_il$cp,
  type = "l", lwd = 3.5, lty = 1,
  las = 1,
  xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 1),
  xaxt = "n",
  xlab = "Duration of Initial Links in Seconds",
  ylab = "Suboptimal Choice Proportion"
)
axis(1, at = c(1, seq(10, 100, 10)))
abline(h = 0.5, lwd = 1, lty = 3, col = "grey")
```

<br>

This approach can be extended to explore the effects of any parameter (or combination of parameters) on predicted choice. Internally, the function will recycle or align vector lengths as needed, but users should verify that values are as they intended to avoid any unexpected behaviour (hence why the message about recycling appears in the console).
