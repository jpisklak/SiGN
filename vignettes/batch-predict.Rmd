## Introduction

In many experimental designs, model parameters vary across conditions or subjects and are conveniently stored in tabular (i.e., spreadsheet) form. In most cases, this kind of information is loaded into R as a data frame. This vignette demonstrates how to use a data frame to generate multiple predictions quickly.

We will walk through the full process using the package's included `subopt_avian` data set as an example.

## The `subopt_avian` Data Set

Dunn et al. (2024) compiled the results of an extensive collection of studies investigating *suboptimal choice* behaviour. This dataset is included in the SiGN package.

The full data set is available as `subopt_full`. For model evaluation purposes, however, Dunn et al. (2024) focused on a curated subset of studies involving pigeons and starlings—particularly pigeons, which were the most extensively studied and yielded the most robust, consistently replicated findings. This filtered dataset is provided as `subopt_avian`.

Each row in `subopt_avian` corresponds to a unique study condition. Many of its columns—specifically columns 9 through 24—map directly to the parameters expected by the `SiGN()` model function (see the `subopt_avian` documentation for full details on the column structure).

```{r}
library(SiGN)

# Display column names
names(subopt_avian)
```

Of special note is column 8 (`$cp`), which contains the observed choice proportion reported for each condition. These values can be directly compared to the choice proportions predicted by the SiGN model, which we will generate shortly.

## Generating a List of Model Parameters

As detailed in the [Get Started](articles/SiGN.html), to generate model predictions with the `SiGN()` function, we first need to prepare a list of model parameters in the format it expects.

These parameters are currently stored as columns in the `subopt_avian` data frame (specifically, columns 9 through 24). However, they are not yet in list form, and some required inputs—such as `s_delta`, `beta_log`, and `beta_toggle`—are not included in the data set. While these defaults are not parameters most users need to adjust, they must be present for `SiGN()` to run properly.

Rather than constructing this list manually, we use the `choice_params()` function. This function not only formats the input correctly but also performs important validation checks to ensure that all required arguments are present and well-formed.

To convert the relevant columns into a list of named arguments, we use `do.call()` in combination with `as.list()`. This allows us to pass the data frame columns directly into `choice_params()` as if we had typed them out individually.

```{r}
# Store Model Parameters
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Extract relevant parameter columns (cols 9–24 align with choice_params())
data_cols <- subopt_avian[9:24]

# Construct model input list
params <- do.call(choice_params, as.list(data_cols))
```

The `do.call()` function dynamically calls `choice_params()` by unpacking the data frame columns into named arguments. In other words, `do.call(choice_params, as.list(data_cols))` transforms each column into an argument like `il_dur_a = ...`, `il_dur_b = ...`, and so on—matching exactly what `choice_params()` expects. This only works because the column names in `subopt_avian[9:24]` are aligned with the argument names that `choice_params()` requires.

## Generating the Predictions

Now that we have constructed a valid list of model parameters, we can pass it to the `SiGN()` function to generate predictions. This function returns a variety of outputs, but here we are specifically interested in the predicted choice proportions.

```{r}
# Generate model predictions
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
preds <- SiGN(params)
```

The SiGN model's predicted choice proportion, for each row of `subopt_avian[9:24]`, can be called with `preds$cp`. These values can be compared directly to the observed choice proportions stored in `subopt_avian$cp`. For more information about the `SiGN()` function and its outputs, see the [Get Started](articles/SiGN.html) article.

## Visualising the Predictions

To help visualise the model's performance, we shall fit a simple linear regression to the observed versus predicted choice proportions. This provides a clear visual summary of their relationship and allows us to overlay both a fitted regression line and a 1:1 reference line. The closer the data points fall to the 1:1 line, the more closely the model’s predictions match the observed values—offering a quick and intuitive check on model accuracy.

```{r}
# Fit a linear model comparing observed vs predicted
reg <- lm(subopt_avian$cp ~ preds$cp)

# Format annotation for plot
reg_txt <- sprintf(
  "y = %.2f + %.2f x\n",
  reg$coefficients[1], reg$coefficients[2]
)
```

```{r fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, dpi = 300, fig.align = 'center', out.width = '75%', message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(mapping = aes(x = preds$cp, y = subopt_avian$cp)) +

  # Add 1:1 reference line (dashed) to assess prediction accuracy
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 3) +

  # Plot each observed vs. predicted data point as an open circle
  geom_point(pch = 1, size = 1.75, stroke = 0.5) +

  # Fit and overlay a linear regression line (no confidence band)
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +

  # Axis labels
  labs(x = "Predicted", y = "Obtained") +

  # Add regression summary text
  annotate("text", x = 0.2, y = 0.9, label = reg_txt, size = 3.5) +

  # Base theme
  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +

  # Make axis text black for visibility
  theme(axis.text = element_text(colour = "black"))
```
